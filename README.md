# Lucky Navin Agrawal | Visual Designer Portfolio (2026)

A digital portfolio showcasing multidisciplinary design work, focusing on clear, structured visual systems across graphic, digital, and motion mediums.

## About the Project
This website serves as the central hub for my creative work, featuring selected projects that span:
* Art Direction & Concept Development
* Visual Identity & Typography
* Motion Design & 3D Exploration
* Packaging & Campaign Systems

The portfolio is designed with a cinematic, editorial approach, utilizing smooth scroll animations, dynamic video integrations, and high-fidelity masonry grids to present each case study (such as Diesel, Lucent, Solaé, Parallel Titles, and Fragments) in its best light.
